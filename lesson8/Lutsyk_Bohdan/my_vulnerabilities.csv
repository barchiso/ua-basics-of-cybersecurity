Microsoft Visual C++ 2013,CVE-2010-3190,CRITICAL,9.3,"Untrusted search path vulnerability in the Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 SP1; Visual Studio 2005 SP1, 2008 SP1, and 2010; Visual C++ 2005 SP1, 2008 SP1, and 2010; and Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 3, 2013, and 2013 allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse dwmapi.dll file in the current working directory during execution of an MFC application such as AtlTraceTool8.exe (aka ATL MFC Trace Tool), as demonstrated by a directory that contains a TRC, cur, rs, rct, or res file, aka ""MFC Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability.""",
Microsoft Visual Studio Code,CVE-2006-4494,HIGH,7.5,"Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code by instantiating certain Visual Studio 6.0 ActiveX COM Objects in Internet Explorer, including (1) tcprops.dll, (2) fp30wec.dll, (3) mdt2db.dll, (4) mdt2qd.dll, and (5) vi30aut.dll.",
Python Add to Path,CVE-2019-9855,CRITICAL,9.8,"LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle vector graphics script, which can execute arbitrary python commands contained with the document it is launched from. LibreOffice also has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be executed on various document script events such as mouse-over, etc. Protection was added to block calling LibreLogo from script event handers. However a Windows 8.3 path equivalence handling flaw left LibreOffice vulnerable under Windows that a document could trigger executing LibreLogo via a Windows filename pseudonym. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice 6.2 versions prior to 6.2.7; 6.3 versions prior to 6.3.1.",
Python Add to Path,CVE-2022-26488,HIGH,7.0,"In Python before 3.10.3 on Windows, local users can gain privileges because the search path is inadequately secured. The installer may allow a local attacker to add user-writable directories to the system search path. To exploit, an administrator must have installed Python for all users and enabled PATH entries. A non-administrative user can trigger a repair that incorrectly adds user-writable paths into PATH, enabling search-path hijacking of other users and system services. This affects Python (CPython) through 3.7.12, 3.8.x through 3.8.12, 3.9.x through 3.9.10, and 3.10.x through 3.10.2.",
